![Dashboard](https://github.com/jviaches/projscope-tasks-source/blob/main/images/dashboard.PNG) 

Projscope Tasks is free, offline, clean and simple task management tool, built with Kanban methodology in mind! ðŸš€

At this moment available for Windows and Linux and I consider it as my contribution to the community. I also plan release Mac version in the future.

**So why Projscope Tasks?**

Projscope Tasks is crafted for solopreneurs and small projects. This tool will ideally help you manage your hobby and pet projects as well as a small business without any problem. It designed for projects where collaboration is not a priority.

Currently it provides core functionality (have lo-o-ong roadmap ahead):
- ðŸ—¸ Create, edit and load tasks projects
- ðŸ—¸ Drag and drop tasks across Backlog. Todo, In progress and Done sections
- ðŸ—¸ Reorder tasks and set task priority
- ðŸ—¸ No need to download new version. Program notify and self update when new version is available.

It has clean and simple design and yet functional for achieving your goals. As it is an initial version, there are a lot of exciting features on their way! To name just a few:

**Scripts:**
- Build for Production: `npm run build`
- Deploy for Production: `npm run deploy`
